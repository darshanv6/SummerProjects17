**ASSIGNMENT 2**

ADJMAT.cpp

A 2D array is used to represent the graph. If i and j are two nodes connected by edges, a[i][j] is 1 else 0.

ADJLIST.cpp

A vector of vectors is used in an adjacency list where vector v[i] shows the nodes connected to i.

BFS.cpp

The graph is traversed so that the neighbours of the current vertex are visited before moving deeper in the graph. This is implemented using a queue. 

DFS.cpp

The graph is traversed so that the neighbours of the current vertex are visited after recursively exhusting all the other routes in the graph. This is implemented using a stack.
